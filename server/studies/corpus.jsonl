Introduction Although stretching is commonly used by many athletes in different sports, recent research has established an adverse effect of acute static stretching on various different maximal performances. Pre-event stretching has demonstrated an inhibitory effect on maximal force or torque production (( 16,24,27 ) and references cited therein), vertical jump performance ( 4,5 ), running speed ( 22,32 ), and muscle endurance ( 23 ).

In contrast to pre-event stretching, doing regular (i.e., daily or 2-3 times per week) stretching seems to have some performance benefit. For example, Worrell et al. ( 33 ) and Handel et al. ( 14 ) found increases in hamstring isokinetic torque. Godges et al. ( 12 ) found increased trunk strength, whereas Wilson et al. ( 30 ) found improvements in the bench press. In addition, Dintiman ( 8 ) reported improved sprint performance, and Hunter and Marshall ( 15 ) saw increases in a countermovement vertical jump. Finally, Kokkonen et al. ( 17 ) have reported that 10 weeks of static stretching alone improved jumping, sprinting, strength, and endurance performances. 9/21/25, 12:18 PM 2.

Unfortunately, training studies, which employ either strength or flexibility training, do not appropriately answer this question. As mentioned above, flexibility training can increase strength ( 12,14,17,30 ). In addition, strength training has been shown to increase flexibility ( 18,20 ). It has not been shown however whether strength training combined with flexibility training results in an alteration in the magnitude of strength gains when compared with a strength training-only program.

How the stretching programs might cause strength gains is up to speculation; however, in a manner similar to resistance training, passive stretching is related to increases in muscle hypertrophy (for reviews see ( 10,13 )). For instance, placing a muscle on stretch can induce Z-line ruptures ( 13 ), increase protein synthesis ( 13 ) and growth factor production, and trigger myoblast proliferation ( 7 ). Moreover, Coutinho et al. ( 6 ) reported a 16% increase in rat soleus fiber area by stretching the muscle for 40 minutes 3 days per week for 3 weeks, whereas Stauber et al. ( 28 ) stretched rat soleus muscles 3 times a week for 4 weeks and found fiber area to be increased by 30%. Interestingly, these stretch-induced gains in hypertrophy are similar to those reported after the initial 6-8 weeks of resistance training ( 3,13,26 ).

Because the responses to stretching and resistance training are similar, it is possible that if both resistance training and stretching are included in a training program, their effects could be additive. It was hypothesized that performing stretching exercises on the no-lifting days would maintain the strength gain stimuli without metabolically stressing the musculature. Therefore, it was the purpose of this study to determine if combining resistance and flexibility exercises to novice exercisers would result in greater early-phase strength gains than performing resistance training alone. Methods Experimental Approach to the Problem To compare the effect of stretching and resistance training to resistance training alone, participants' strength was assessed before and after engaging in either a resistance training program or a resistance training combined with stretching.

When more than 2 individuals matched up for 1RM, the 2 with the closest body masses were paired. Among the volunteers, 8 pairs of men and 8 pairs of women were found to fit the matching criteria.

Discussion The primary purpose of this study was to determine if stretching exercises have a synergistic or additive influence on the strength gains normally seen during the early phase of a standard resistance training program. The results of this study suggest that for people beginning a resistance training program, the addition of stretching activities on the non-lifting days may accelerate strength gains. Although this study was not designed to investigate the responsible mechanism(s), it is most probable that the stretching-based strength improvements are related to morphological changes.

The relationship between static stretching and increases in muscle hypertrophy also has support in cell and animal research. For instance, a continually applied stretch for 10 days can trigger myoblast proliferation ( 7 ). In addition, Stauber et al.

The synergistic influence of the stretching program on strength gains might also be related to increases in muscle length. Increases in length lead to increases in both contractile velocities and the forces generated at a given shortening velocity ( 19 ). In situ lengthening has been reported through the application of diverse mechanisms of continuous stretch such as casting a muscle in a stretched position, increasing bone length, or relocating tendon insertions (for a review see ( 19 )). Also, muscle lengthening results from programs of intermittent stretching 9/21/25, 12:18 PM 2.

As pointed out by Sale ( 26 ) and Folland and Williams ( 10 ), many studies using a typical 8-week strength training program involving nascent lifters have shown that the strength changes are greatly associated with neural adaptations and learning. Some of these changes include improvements in motor unit recruitment, agonist activation, firing frequency, motor unit synchronization, and antagonist coactivation. Because stretching activities involve movements in that are generally opposite to movements used in a 1RM (e.g., knee flexors are stretching by doing knee extension), it is difficult to see how stretching would enhance the learning compone","meta":{"title":"2.

Moreover, using electromyogram and twitch interpolation techniques, several researchers have determined that pre-event stretching causes a decrease in muscle activation ( 1,2,11 ). Hence, static stretch induces a neurological response that is opposite to that coinciding with resistance training. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the strength gains seen in this study have a close tie with any neural adaptations and learning. Although the improvements in muscle strength are a desired training modification for the athletic population, the results of this study do not suggest that the addition of stretching exercises to traditional resistance exercise will enhance existing training programs.

Although stretching improved the performance of sporadically active individuals, it is not known if people with more trained muscles will respond similarly to the stretching stimulus. On the other hand, improvements in muscle strength, endurance, and power can also be important to the nonathletic population. Several studies have established a link between muscular fitness and overall health or the likelihood of early death ( 4,9,21 ). Unfortunately, most persons who are at the lowest end of the muscular fitness continuum also have difficulty performing the usual activities found to generate improvements in muscular fitness.

What is not known at this time and still needs to be addressed is whether or not stretching, when added to resistance exercise on the same day in close proximity to other forms of exercise, will have an additive benefit on performance. Considering that many individuals perform stretching as part of a cool down process upon cessation of other forms of exercise, it would be interesting to discover whether or not stretching, when added to the end of a strength training workout, can enhance gains in muscular performance.

In other words, how much stretching does it take before gains in muscular performance are realized? Recent research into the deleterious effects of preexercise stretching suggests that as little as one 30-second stretch can lead to a reduction in maximal strength in an acute sense ( 31 ). Could the reverse be true for chronic stretching? Or are multiple stretches per muscle group needed to see chronic gains in strength? Additional research is warranted to investigate the possible mechanisms behind stretch-induced strength gains along with the relationship between the volume and duration of stretching and muscular performance adaptations. In addition, future research should attempt to investigate the manner in which the timing of stretching in relation to other forms of exercise affects possible strength and power gains.

At the same results (kg), the results showed that the arithme- tic mean of the group participants changed statistically significantly during the experiment. This, in turn, shows that the method we use gives a positive effect.

It's more effective to teach technique in a rational order that addresses the details as they arise than to attempt to later correct tech- nique faults that have al - ready become habit. Because of the overlap of many of the details with the snatch, some information has been left out of the clean progression to avoid redundancy.

Because the narrower grip places the bar- bell against the upper thighs instead of in the crease of the hips as it was in the snatch, it's important the lifter not drag the bar up the thighs or bring the shoulders behind the bar prematurely, as this will cause the bar to be pushed forward by the thighs as the knees shift forward in the double knee bend.

The split jerk is by far the most common competi- tive jerk style, and will be the end of the jerk learning progression. However, the power jerk will also be learned as a part of that progres- sion. The squat jerk will be discussed in more detail in the following section of the book. The power jerk is named such because the receiving position is identical to those of the power snatch and power clean - feet in the squat stance and thighs above horizontal. (The name push jerk is often used synonymously for power jerk; the two can be distinguished by defining a push jerk as a power jerk in which the feet re- main connected to the platform rather than be- ing lifted and replaced.)

Additionally, there exists little margin for error in bar position - the bar must be driven quite precisely into position overhead in order for the athlete to maintain its stability. The squat jerk is identical in foot position to the power jerk, but as the name implies, the ultimate receiving position is a squat. This clearly requires less elevation of the bar than the power jerk, but also introduces a few unique elements of difficulty. Mobility is an immediate limiting factor for most athletes a relatively nar- row - grip overhead squat is out of reach for lift- ers outside of the most mobile end of the spec- trum. Additionally, there exists the need for precision in bar placement seen in the power jerk -- little can be done to stabilize a bar that is even slightly out of position.

Finally, consider the difficulty of recovering from the bottom of a close - grip overhead squat, often from a dead stop, particularly immediately following the effort to clean the weight. It is an extremely ra- re individual who possesses the mobility, preci- sion and leg strength to make this jerk style successful. This said, there will likely be an increase in the frequency of squat jerking in coming years, particularly among the smaller weight classes, as coaches and lifters find that jerk weights cannot keep pace with increases in the clean, and find ways to better train lifters from the start of their careers to receive and recover from squat jerks more effectively.

The split jerk is the most common style used by competitive weightlifters for very sim- ple reasons it allows relatively great receiving depth while keeping recovery from such depths relatively easy, accommodates much greater imprecision in the overhead position of the bar than the power or squat jerk, and provides greater stability in all directions than the power or squat jerk.

It has been shown that this type of exercise can improve both physical fitness and metabolic health [5]. Resistance exercise induces a pronounced acute hormonal response. Such responses are more likely to be relevant for tissue growth and remodeling than chronic changes in baseline hormone concentrations [6].

In patients with chronic heart failure, aerobic exercise is usually prescribed, while resistance exercises are oriented toward muscle force enhancement [8]. Resistance exercises have been indicated to be valuable in preserving muscle mass and bone mass during old age [9]. It would be an excellent way of managing pain without straining the body too much. Not everyone can bear high- intensity aerobic exercises [10]. Very few studies have defined their conditions for resistance exercise in detail. They have usually focused on things like load magnitude, rest periods, and frequency of the sessions [11].

The decline in strength often seen with age is frequently attributed to decreasing muscle mass in older individuals [13]. Resistance training is a great way to boost muscle growth and improve overall function [14]. Older adults who are healthy may experience improvements in mitochondrial function and muscle strength after six months of resistance training to fix these issues (of weak muscles and less effective cells) in how they appear and fix them in their gene activity [15].

So, while just nutritional supplements might not completely stop muscle loss from cachexia, pairing them with an anabolic agent could help slow down or even prevent further muscle breakdown [17]. Also, it is super important to include various interventions like nutrition and exercise in plans for monitoring, evaluation, and discharge. These play a key role in preserving muscle mass and function in settings, be it clinical or community environments [18]. Sleep plays a big part in muscle recovery by influencing hormone secretion. Not getting enough sleep messes with blood hormones and cytokines that help with muscle recovery [19].

Athletes need their beauty sleep since all the tough training can lead to sleep problems that mess with how much quality and quantity of sleep they get [22]. Sleep restriction is believed to be related to the loss of muscle mass in both humans and animals [23]. The belief that exercise enhances sleep is partially rooted in traditional theories suggesting that sleep functions to conserve energy, restore the body, and regulate temperature—all concepts that have heavily influenced research in this field [24].

It is significantly affected by inputs from the entire body [25]. The primary approach directing skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a three-way mechanism: satellite cell activation, expansion or proliferation, and differentiation. Resistance exercise can create additional regulators that activate these cells and thus make contributory gains in muscle fiber size and number [26][27]. During childhood, skeletal muscles become larger primarily by hypertrophy - the expansion in size of individual muscle fibers. In contrast, muscle atrophy occurs from a state in which protein degradation rates become higher than protein synthesis rates [27].

Also, skeletal muscles are pretty good at adapting to changes in the mechanical environment at both tissue and systemic levels. But, we are still figuring out exactly how mechanical signals turn into chemicals that affect muscle growth and metabolism [30]. Proteins are like the superheroes of cells, doing all sorts of important jobs like being tiny motors and helping with signaling. They also help out in chemical reactions, move stuff around, build up viral capsids, and create channels in membranes. They are super crucial for passing on genetic info from DNA to RNA [31].

Likewise, when amino acids don’t get broken down in the small intestine, they take a ride through the portal vein to join in making proteins in muscles and other tissues [32]. Eating protein can rev up your energy use because your body has to work hard to make protein and urea and do gluconeogenesis. Diets with top-notch proteins that have all the vital amino acids can jack up energy use more than ones with lower-quality proteins [33]. The balance between making new proteins and breaking them down is key for growing protein levels in tissues because of continuous turnover [34]. Keeping your muscles healthy involves a back-and-forth between breaking down proteins (also known as protein turnover) when you’re not eating (fasting) and building them back up when you chow down (feeding) [4].

People with different activity levels should aim for higher protein intakes. For those with minimal activity, it’s recommended to have 1.0 g/kg BW/day. If you’re moderately active, shoot for 1.3 g/kg BW/day. And if you’re going intense, try to reach 1.6 g/kg BW/day. It’s generally safe for healthy adults to consume 2 g/kg BW/day of protein over the long term. However, don’t go overboard – the upper limit is 3.5 g/kg BW/day for individuals used to high protein diets [32].

This will help your body grow stronger because it boosts growth hormones like testosterone and IGF1 (Insulin-like growth factor 1), MPS by activating mTOR [128]. When athletes don’t get enough sleep, they’re more likely to get hurt because their bodies break down protein faster and don’t build muscle as well [22]. Moreover, after not moving around for a while or due to inactivity, our muscles can become resistant to the effects of food. Even if we eat well, we might still lose muscle mass over time. A study found that after just 7 days of eating a regular diet and then switching to simulated weightlessness for 14 days, people experienced a significant decrease in MPS of a staggering 50%, in both leg and overall lean body mass. Likewise, there was a 46% reduction in fractional MPS by tracer integration into muscle protein.

Whereas, there have been hundreds of individual studies on each of them. This review has illustrated multiple training protocols as well as the timing, quality, and quantity of dietary protein requirements for optimal MPS. The role of sleep and its effects on exercise intensity, strength, protein digestion, and, of course, whole-body MPS in a given period have been established.

Protein is required for preserving and growing muscle mass. Likewise, having adequate sleep is mandatory, as an average human spends one-third of their lifetime sleeping. The rise in population gives an invitation to a rapid boost of new kinds of diseases and climatic changes. So, in the coming years, it will become a challenge to prevent diseases and keep a larger fraction of the population physically fit and active. Adding to that, understanding the mechanisms involved in MPS through the synergy of these three aspects becomes essential.

Resistance exercise, on the one hand, provides a strong stimulus to muscle growth, while protein supplementation provides the necessary amino for muscle repair and growth. Of these three factors, sleep has been recognized as one of the important elements sustaining physiological and biochemical processes integral to muscle recovery and growth.

{"text":"ocesses integral to muscle recovery and growth. It has been demonstrated that a dose of 20-30 grams of protein at each meal will induce a maximal MPS response, provided the frequency is three to four times daily [77]. Resistance exercise combined with increased protein provision after exercise has been shown to enhance skeletal MPS rates during acute ED and can also contribute to preserving muscle mass during longer-term ED. [81]. 30 grams of PRO can increase MyoPS, it shoots up to a huge 46% per hour compared to no protein at all. That is one leap! But on an interesting note, while it does wonders after endurance exercise, it doesn’t do much for mitochondrial protein synthesis [85]. Whey protein dominates when it comes to pumping muscle protein synthesis. It outs soy, intact casein, and even hydrolyzed casein [90]. After having chugged down some whey, the muscle protein synthesis goes up by a whopping 93% more than that by casein and by 18% more than soy.

And get this - after exercise, the muscle protein synthesis post-whey intake spikes up by 31% higher than soy and an incredible 122% higher than casein [98]. Now, moving to EAA CHO consumption after resistance exercise: it does a great job in promoting muscle protein synthesis during recovery post-exercise. However, here comes the catch: it doesn’t do anything to help boost muscle protein synthesis before a workout [99]. In terms of one year of protein supplementation versus an isocaloric control supplement, they do not show any significant effect on MPS levels either at the pre- or post-meal stage or during the recovery period [107]. More recently, one study has emphasized that high-protein (leucine-enriched whey) consumption may prevent—or, at least, partly offset—the negative effects of weight loss on skeletal muscle mass [109]. It is confirmed that the human musc","meta":{"title":"2410.16169v1","file":"2410.16169v1.pdf"}}
{"text":"umption may prevent—or, at least, partly offset—the negative effects of weight loss on skeletal muscle mass [109]. It is confirmed that the human muscle synthetic rate increased by as much as 50% as early as 4 hours after heavy resistance training, before reaching as high as 109% at the 24-hour mark post-workout [45]. A mixed muscle protein synthesis rate is induced within a time as short as 4 hours following an intensive plyometric muscle contractions-based exercise. Curiously, resistance training somewhat puts a damper on this spike in rates [47]. At the start of a workout, both older adults and younger individuals experienced significant improvements in their leg muscles, with no noticeable change in overall muscle breakdown [49]. Over three days, the leg that was exercised showed a marked increase in muscle growth compared to the untrained leg[ 51]. As expected, the trained leg exhibited a much greater increase than the untrained leg within four hours; however, it was also anticipa","meta":{"title":"2410.16169v1","file":"2410.16169v1.pdf"}}

As expected, the trained leg exhibited a much greater increase than the untrained leg within four hours; however, it was also anticipated that both legs’ muscle protein synthesis rates would rise after eight weeks of one-legged resistance training [52]. Additionally, during both concentric and eccentric resistance exercises, muscle protein synthesis was elevated above resting levels at every measured time point: 112% at three hours, 65% at 24 hours, and finally 34% at 48 hours. Moreover, the rate of muscle breakdown was also heightened after exercise at three hours and again at 24 hours, but by the end of that period, it returned to resting levels [56]. Thus, for beginners, the muscle protein synthesis immediately following that first workout doesn’t necessarily correlate with muscle growth from subsequent resistance training [57]. Now, let’s turn our attention to myosin heavy chain and mixed protein synthesis rates in older adults.

It appears that these rates decline more significantly compared to actin, and the variability in measurements is greater for actin than for myosin heavy chain or mixed muscle protein [60]. When you engage in exercise and your muscles contract, muscle protein synthesis increases. This is true for both men and women, with no significant differences in leg muscle responses among young adults [45]. Additionally, muscle protein synthesis returns to near baseline levels within a few hours after exercising for both younger individuals (around 24 years old) and older adults (approximately 70 years old) with similar body mass indexes [46].

This indicates that the duration your muscles are under tension during workouts may be crucial for promoting muscle growth [63]. Endurance exercise (EE) has been shown to increase mitochondrial protein synthesis in both untrained individuals (by an impressive 154%) and trained individuals (by 105%), but it did not have the same effect on myofibrillar synthesis after 10 weeks. Essentially, performing endurance exercises with one leg does not immediately stimulate myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis, regardless of training status. It primarily seems to enhance mitochondrial protein synthesis [64].

Moreover, consuming protein before bedtime did not seem to 22 arXiv Template A P REPRINT influence muscle damage markers or strength levels the following morning for regular weightlifters.

Consuming around 40 grams of protein before bed aids your muscles in synthesizing more protein while you rest [119]. However, missing out on sleep for just one night can disrupt your body’s muscle-building capabilities and may lead to a catabolic state [120]. Having protein before sleep increases amino acids in your bloodstream, promoting muscle growth while maintaining your body’s overall protein levels. Plus, you don’t need to worry about feeling uncomfortable; a reasonable amount of protein before bed won’t upset your stomach [124]. Athletes who don’t get enough sleep are at a higher risk of injury. This is due to their bodies signaling more breakdown of muscle proteins and less synthesis, which weakens their muscles over time [22].

When muscle protein synthesis decreases, it typically indicates that fewer amino acids are being transported within the cells. This suggests that during periods of inactivity, our muscles begin to lose proteins, impacting both our overall body and specific muscle groups [129]. In a study involving older adults on bed rest for 10 days, they experienced significant muscle mass loss, particularly in their legs. Interestingly, even before their bed rest, they were not achieving a sufficient nitrogen balance despite consuming the recommended amount of protein [134]. Finally, many athletes face challenges with sleep management, which can negatively affect their cognitive abilities, effort levels, and overall health related to exercise adaptation [142].

Optimal. Thus, good primal strength becomes the main capital applied in the match. At the weightlifting branch there are 2 types of lifts namely Snatch and Clean & Jerk. Each type is given a chance for 3 generations, in each class. The lifter is given the opportunity to lift the barbell 3 times according to his ability. The second batch can be added another 5 Kg, the third batch added another 2.5 Kg and so on. Valid lifts get values, then add up and get what is called Total Lift for each lift type.

To facilitate learning and exercise, classifications in weightlifting exercises are held according to their characteristics. Usually, all weightlifting exercises are divided into: cl assic and support (classic and assistance). Classical strength is what is done in international competitions, namely Snatch and Clean and Jerk (Gupta & Goswami, 2001) . Supporting exercises are carried out in daily practice.

And overall, the body will feel less injured alias stress because the muscles become more flexi ble (Sobolenko et al., 2020) .

{"text":"h a progressive decrease in physical function, loss of physical independence, an increased probability of falls, and reduced quality of life. 1-3 Maintaining function well during late life is as important as prolonging life expectancy in older adults. 4 Considering that the global aging population is projected to double in number to approximately 1.5 billion by 2050, preserving physical function is a major public health concern. 5,6 Despite the potential public health impact, few interventions exist to slow the decrease in physical function. Physical activity, and in particular strength training, is a major strategy to prevent or delay mobility disability in older adults. Strength training is recommended in older adults to improve physical function. 7-10 However, muscle power has emerged as an important factor in physical function.

{"text":"nction. During the aging process, muscle power decreases at a faster rate than strength, 11 and several reports suggest that muscle power is more highly correlated with physical function than strength or muscle mass. 12-14 In contrast to traditional strength training, power training (PT) or high-velocity resistance training involves moving the resistance at higher velocities during the lifting (concentric) phase, followed by a controlled lowering (eccentric) phase. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that PT is more beneficial than traditional resistance training for improving physical function. 15,16 However, those reviews included studies using plyometric exercises, such as depth jumps and countermovement jumps. 17,18 Unlike PT that uses slow, controlled eccentrics, plyometric training uses rapid eccentric movement immediately followed by a rapid concentric contraction to initiate the stretch-shortening cycle. 19 Furthermore, previous analyse","meta":{"title":"balachandran_2022_oi_220346_1651687174.65039","file":"balachandran_2022_oi_220346_1651687174.65039.pdf"}}
{"text":"eccentric movement immediately followed by a rapid concentric contraction to initiate the stretch-shortening cycle. 19 Furthermore, previous analyses included studies with multiple cointerventions across groups. For example, the largest study used standing functional exercises for PT, and the control group used seated exercises. 20 The inclusion of multiple interventions makes it impossible to assess the specific outcomes associated with PT. Therefore, the actual utility of PT per se in functional outcomes in older adults is still uncertain. Considering the limitations of the literature, we systematically reviewed PT vs traditional strength training and measures of physical function in community-living older adults. Moreover, we carried out a multilevel meta-analysis to quantify the magnitude of the outcomes.

Unlike previous reviews, we evaluated the certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence using the GRADE method. 24 We also included self-reported function as a primary outcome.

To assess the clinical relevance of these measures, we back-transformed the SMD to natural units for the most common tests: based on SDs from a large, observational cohort of community-living older adults, 55 for GUG (SMD, 0.34), we estimated a mean (SD) 0.62 (1.85)-second improvement, and for chair stands (SMD, 0.13), a 0.56 (4.3)-stands improvement.

For other secondary outcomes, data suggest that gait speed, strength, and muscle mass were not associated. The intensity and volume used was similar for both groups for most studies; hence, similar findings in strength and muscle mass may be expected. Most studies showing improvements in habitual gait speed used multicomponent exercise programs, such as over-ground walking. 59,60 The results of secondary outcomes are consistent with a previous meta-analysis. 15 Adverse events were minimal and similar between the groups.

Conclusions We recommend that future PT studies obtain larger and better-justified sample sizes, measure both performance and self-reported functional outcomes, track power during workout sessions using an objective measure, and emphasize the proper conduct and reporting of important methodological domains. Power training requires the person to move the weight faster in the lifting phase. This directive can be challenging, especially in individuals who are very old or cognitively impaired. Nevertheless, like traditional strength training, PT can be performed using weight machines, pneumatic machines, or body weight, and thus there are no added cost or feasibility issues. Furthermore, there was no increase in adverse effects or serious adverse events reported. However, the low number of adverse events should be interpreted cautiously owing to the small sample size of the included studies and insufficient reporting.

It would be prudent for benefits, harms, cost, and client values/preferences to be evaluated before PT practice guidelines provide recommendations on PT in older adults. Based on the available evidence, our systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that PT was associated with a modest improvement in physical function compared with traditional strength training in healthy older adult participants in RCTs. However, robust, large trials are warranted to make definitive statements. ARTICLE INFORMATION Accepted for Publication: February 26, 2022.

Skeletal muscle is the primary metabolic “sink” for glucose and triglyceride disposal and is an important deter- minant of resting metabolic rate.

Accordingly, these patient subsets may require more careful evaluation and initial monitoring, and RT guidelines and recommendations must be modified accordingly.

Resistance Training and Diabetes Diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance are central features of coronary artery disease risk, being strongly related to hypertension and dyslipidemia, proinflam- matory markers, thrombogenic factors, and endothelial dys- function.

Unfortunately, central obesity and physical inactivity hinder medical management and may hasten development of chronic complications, par- ticularly in elderly people with long-standing diabetes. Even when glycemic control is near optimal with medication, reducing insulin resistance by any other means must be explored in view of these adverse consequences. Muscle contraction increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, 34 thereby forming the basis for recommending RT for individuals with abnormal glucose metabolism. Aerobic ex- ercise uses large muscle groups for extended periods of time, but whole-body RT programs may provide equally high or higher recruitment of muscle mass over a comparable period of time.

A conventional RT protocol generally consists of lifting heavier weights with longer rest periods, whereas a circuit RT protocol consists of lifting lighter weights with shorter rest periods between exercises. By moving quickly between exercises and by using lighter weight with higher repetitions, circuit training introduces an aerobic component to the workout. 54 In the more recent meta-analysis, Cornelissen and Fagard 26 pooled data from studies published between 1996 and 2003 that included 9 randomized controlled trials involving 341 participants.

For example, resting energy expenditure (REE) decreases with aging, and this decrease is closely correlated to losses in skeletal muscle mass. 76 RT increases muscle mass by a minimum of 1 to 2 kg in studies of sufficient duration. 77 Theoretically, a gain of 1 kg in muscle mass should result in an REE increase of approxi- mately 21 kcal/kg of new muscle. 78 In practice, RT interven- tion studies report REE increases in the range of 28 to 218 kcal/kg of muscle. 79 – 82 RT, when sustained over years or decades, translates into clinically i","meta":{"title":"braith-stewart-2006-resistance-exercise-training","file":"braith-stewart-2006-resistance-exercise-training.pdf"}}

Knowledge of presentations of menopause and impact of menopausal symptoms on training allows women and health care providers to make informed treatment decisions. Introduction Exercise has a large impact on preservation of muscle power and cellular function and on maintaining an active independent lifestyle for older adults [1, 2]. Olympic-style weightlifting, for example, requires strength, speed, and explosive power [3, 4]. Individuals differ widely in how they age and in how they adapt to an exercise program [5]. Several recommendations have been published by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) on quantity and quality of exercise for optimal cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness [6].

{"text":"uscular fitness [6]. However, despite the recognized benefits of exercise, physical and mental health or lifestyle demands may present obstacles to regular maintenance of an exercise regimen. Masters weightlifters are aged 35 and up, and age-associated performance decline for these has been studied for Masters weightlifters performing at high level competitions [7–11]. However, these studies were based on data from World Championships or world records and thus may not apply directly to a broader popula- tion including athletes at the local or more recreational level. Our study seeks to expand these investigations to that broader population. While exercise cannot stop the biological aging process, a rigorous training regime may lead to slower declines in strength or aerobic capacity from their maximal values [1]. However, faulty training strategies can lead to overuse injuries which can be a major detriment to con- tinuing the training regime [12].

Athletes and coaches should thus be made aware of patterns of injuries for older ages to inform their design of prevention strategies. Data regarding the manner in which this older population is able to engage in intense physical activities, despite frequent health challenges arising from chronic disease or injuries, can inform sport scientists and medical health professionals and help guide their recommendations. This type of informa- tion is particularly important for sports that have undergone rapid growth in popularity among older adults, since such growth inevitably attracts a vast new population of individuals who are at relatively high risk for injury. Olympic-style weightlifting is one such sport, for its worldwide popularity among older adults has exploded in recent years due to the CrossFit phe- nomenon.

Participation in Masters weightlifting for individuals age 35 and up has grown rap- idly, with women’s participation in particular increasing by roughly an order of magnitude over the past decade. The dramatic recent increase has come most often from those without prior experience in weightlifting. The participation rate in the USA National Masters Weigh- tlifting Championships has changed from 2015 with 244 competitors (44.4% female and 55.6% male) to 718 in 2019 (with 58.7% female and 41.3% male). Over a ten-year period, from 2009 to 2019, the proportion of women competitors in this event climbed from 14% to 59%.

An overall reduction in the exercise training stimulus (i.e. exercise-training intensity, session duration and weekly frequency) with advancing age is associated with a reduction in endurance exercise performance. However, a causal link is not clear, since many factors underlie the decreasing ability to maintain exercise intensity and vol- ume with increasing age [13]. We seek to shed light on this issue by examining a wide range of factors that may affect performance of Masters weightlifters.

Thus, the pop- ulation surveyed is not, for the most part, composed of individuals who have participated in weightlifting training or competition since their youth; instead, they are predominantly nov- ices in the sport with less than 5 years of experience.

Physical, psychological and social benefits for competitive athletes in a variety of sports have been investigated in older adults [22] and perceptions of such benefits have been exam- ined for participants at World Masters Games [26, 27].

In this study we were able to examine the demographic, training, and health-related details of a cohort of older adults who engage in one particular sport at a range of levels, from elite world champions to those who participate only at local clubs and recreation centers. The sport of weightlifting has been growing in recent years with participants at all ages, many without prior experience in weightlifting, and some without being physically active for many years. In this sense, the rapidly expanding Masters weightlifting phenomenon can be seen as a challenge to negative stereotypes of aging that include increasing affliction by disease and poor quality of life [26, 28].

Lack of access to facilities, and environments that focus on younger athletes were also mentioned. This is a highly educated and affluent group;85% were post-secondary graduates. The great majority were white (84%), and most were married (72%). It is important to note that similar distributions have also been observed in other studies of Masters athletes.

Masters weightlifters across all age groups train “long and often” (1–2 hours, 3–5 days/ week) and also engage in multiple sports. This surpasses the exercise guidelines from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine of 3–5 days per week for 20–60 minute sessions with 2–3 days per week resistance training [6]. For older athletes an overall reduction in training “stimulus” has been observed [13], referring to exercise-training intensity, session duration, and weekly frequency. Naturally, there is a decline in the actual weights lifted as athletes age. Nevertheless, in this cohort of weightlifters, the length of a training session was 1 hour or more for over 86% of the women across all age groups.

Men with at least 20 years of experiences in the age group 45–59, train fewer days and in shorter sessions compared to men with less experience of the same age; they also design their own training program more frequently. We have no data regarding “intensity” of training defined as percentage of maximum weights lifted, although anecdotes suggest that this generally declines with age as a safeguard against injury.

The reality of having to adjust training regimes to accommodate aging bodies needs to be acknowledged by athletes and coaches in order to train more safely and not run the risk of overtraining that might lead to injuries. While the peak starting age for weightlifting for most survey partici- pants was 34 or 35, for both women and men, a subgroup of 15% of the men had started train- ing as teenagers or in their early twenties. In some sports, a greater proportion of males participate at a younger age than females. The reasons are not known, but boys may be encour- aged more to participate in sport at a young age than girls [32]. However, weightlifting for women is a relatively new phenomenon, with Olympic women’s competition not having started until the year 2000.

Physical health and injuries It is notable that only a very small proportion of Masters weightlifters reported that chronic diseases had affected training moderately or considerably, although it is higher in those ages 60 and over. This could be due to the fact that sport participants have a significantly lower preva- lence of chronic diseases compared to non-athletes [24, 33]. It is possible that only the healthi- est athletes continue to train at older ages. On the other hand, while chronic diseases and injuries affect their training, as reported in this study, it is of note that Masters athletes con- tinue to train through setbacks and obstacles [28].

Several commented that their injuries resulted from other sports or from prior injuries. This is congruent with a Finnish study of top-level competitive athletes aged 15–35, in which it was found that the major- ity of the many injuries occurred in sports other than the main one [41]. Also, competitive ath- letes reported that for 36 to 38% of acute or overuse injuries there was a prior injury at the same location [41].

The reported rates of injury-imposed restrictions on weightlifting training over a 2-year period in this population are lower than reported injury rates in running or other sports over a 1-year period. However, the prevalence of injuries could be higher in this population, since injuries were only reported if they restricted training moderately or considerably. Taking into account that a large proportion of these injuries may be due to other activities or prior injuries, the findings suggest that it is important for older adults, their coaches, and health providers to acknowledge the contribution of type of physical activities, training load, and weightlifting technique on safety, especially when coupled with underlying medical conditions such as old injuries.

This could be due to the sport discipline studied, a focus on younger athletes, or the type of study (inter- vention versus retrospective observational study). An important finding of this study was the age and gender disparity in shoulder problems mediated by years of competition experience. There is a difference between weightlifters who are relatively new to the sport with less than 5 years competition experience compared to those who trained in weightlifting longer. Those with less experience have a higher probability of shoulder issues with no difference between men and women.

They are comparable to the prevalence of anxiety disorders among individuals from Euro/Anglo cultures (4–10%) which are higher than in other cultures [44, 45], but older adults report less worry than younger adults [46].

Similar to the popularity of resistance training as a physical activity, the sport of weightlifting has enjoyed an unprecedented increase in participation in recent years, especially among women [ 1 ]. For example, from 2015 to 2019 the participation rate in the USA National Masters Weightlifting Championships has increased dramatically, from 244 to 718 competitors [ 2 ]. Moreover, there were 196 weightlifters who competed in the German National Masters Championships 2021, the highest number in recent years. Older athletes are making use of increased opportunities to participate in competitive sports. This is despite a greater risk of chronic diseases with older age that need to be considered when designing training regimens [3].

General concepts of weightlifting program designs over a time period include specificity of exercises, overload, and variability, but program designs vary among internationally competitive weightlifters [ 9 , 12 – 14 ]. Older athletes may respond more slowly to training stimuli than younger athletes and take longer for recovery and concurrent training may be needed [ 15 ]. Training for Masters athletes varies widely because of demands on time, health reasons, or physical and functional capacity.

There are many ways to design successful training programs. Different volumes, intensities, frequencies, or selection of exercises are used in training programs by successful Master weightlifters, who have found ways to experiment, modify, and adapt to their needs [ 16 ]. Preconceived notions of what activities and training volumes older athletes can tolerate may be discussed on social media and in blog posts. However, coach education programs include only limited information about the needs of older athletes [ 17 ].

While cross-training has been studied for endurance athletes [ 18 , 19 ], little is known about cross-training for weightlifters, particularly for those in older age groups. Weightlifting athletes compete in body-weight categories and thus are often careful about diet before competitions. Little is known about how much importance weightlifters assign to nutrition for their training. To answer some of these questions on how Masters weightlifters train and their perception of nutrition, we surveyed Masters weightlifters from six countries.

Compared to other regions, in Europe fewer weightlifters trained at home (10.3% of the females and 18.3% of the males) and most often in weightlifting clubs (75.9% of the females and 80.2% of the males). Over 40% of the males in Australia, Canada, and the USA reported that they trained at home, but multiple locations were possible. The largest proportion of males utilizing their own training program were Europeans (71.4%). In Canada and Europe, 3 training days per week was more common than in Australia and the USA where 4 days prevailed. There were fewer training hours per week in Canada and Europe (median 6 h) than in Australia and the USA (median 7.5 h). A training session typically lasted 1.5 to 2 h across regions and sex.

Overall, the time spent on competition lifts and strength exercises was similar across regions. Competition lifts in a training session typically lasted between 30 and 60 min, although more than 20% of males and females trained more than 1 hour. While females agreed or strongly agreed about the relevance of nutrition for training (85.3%), fewer males found nutrition relevant (74.8%), and this differed across regions: 86.3% in Australia, 83.8% in the USA, 64.8% in Canada, and 54.0% in Europe. 3.2. Sport Participation Prior to Weightlifting To the question, “Have you participated in sports or physical activities before you started weightlifting?” more than 90% of the survey participants reported that they had par- ticipated in other sports before starting weightlifting (Table 4).

CrossFit was most common in the youngest age group, especially among females (75.0% females and 63.2% males ). Other popular activities were ball sports, such as soccer or volleyball, and bodybuild- ing/strength training (37%). In the age group 45–59 years, CrossFit was also most common for females (69.8% for females and 42.5% for males), while many males had prior experi- ence with ball sports (53.5%) and had already engaged in strength training (41.0%). In the 60+ years group, CrossFit, endurance, and fitness were among the most common sports for females prior to weightlifting while ball sports and strength training was reported by males. More females than males practiced mobility activities such as yoga and Pilates across all age groups. There were regional differences.

Some practical aspects to consider for the training of older weightlifters are: • In our study we found that older female weightlifters may have capacity for a higher training frequency than older males, • Concurrent aerobic physical activities could be added to the training program to reach WHO guidelines to help maintain health and fitness at older ages without it being detrimental to the strength gains [35], • Engagement in concurrent training and other sports needs to be considered to ensure proper recovery and avoid overtraining, • More emphasis could be put on nutrition. Most females in this study were aware of its benefits on weightlifting training and recovery, but that awareness was lacking in some older male weightlifters.

Appendix A The USA surveys were conducted in January 2020 (pre-pandemic [ 2 ]) and in June 2021, after the COVID-19 pandemic was already in place for over a year. Survey questions in 2021 referred to typical training weeks pre-pandemic, so responses relied on recall. The participants in 2021 were slightly older (mean 50.2 versus 47.5 years in 2020, p < 0.001 ), but had similar proportions of females and males. In both years the athletes primarily followed a program by a coach, but a larger proportion in 2021 also used their own program to supplement or on its own (26.2% vs. 17.7%, p < 0.001).

Exercises follow the order from Olympic lifts to strengthening lifts in order to present the importance of mastering the technique which is involved with classical weightlift- ing. In this matter, it is logical and crucial to start the learning process backwards from most advanced to very basics. This order gives the athlete all the tools to execute the movements included in the manual. Classical weightlifting and the strengthening movements included are one of the most complicated full body exercises in the world. The challenge is mastering every single detail within the technique and learning how your body functions during these move- ments.

Why choose Olympic weightlifting and the multiple variations from it over other train- ing methods, which can be practiced at the gym? Strength training is essential in order to make human body function, because without constant strain and workload our muscles and bones will atrophy. When taking a closer look to strength training and especially Olympic lifts, it is essential to comprehend how all-encompassing these movements are to our musculoskeletal, when training with open weights and barbell. This can be demonstrated with the muscle balance triangle, which includes: Mobility- action of joints, power- action of muscles and coordination- combined action of nerv- ous system and muscles.

When aiming for good and strong posture and muscle balance and learning the correct lifting technique it creates you the requirements for healthy lifestyle and pre- vents injuries in the future in your everyday life. Weightlifting techniques are also excel- lent for muscle maintenance and bone training and it increases the bones thickness and mass.

When comparing a child’s ability to recover from short anaerobic performances to adults, the chil dren’s recovery is significantly efficient than adults. It is studied that children are capable of performing over ten maximal few second sprints with only short recovery time (15-30 seconds). The adults body demands more recovery time compared to the exact same perfor- mance and the top athletes are usually capable of executing their performances with maximum capacity less than ten times. (Hakkarainen et al 2009, 73).

These factors are greatly affected by three interdepended, but still independent developmental biological phenomenon’s; Physical growth, biological mat- uration and physiological development.

(Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 74). Biological mat uration means the body’s maturation towards an adult’s maturation level. There are two factors which are connected with maturation; timetable and speed. Timetable describes when the maturation of genitals starts, when the growth spurts top is reached and when height growth ends. Speed describes how fast the height growth is and how fast the individual’s sexual maturation reaches to the ultimate maturity.

Physiological development means the body’s systems and structures differenti ation and their functional development such as; differentiation of muscle cells into fast direction and the reproduction of aerobic enzyme activities. The physiological development is mainly dependent on growth and maturation, but the environment and especially pre- adolescent exercise have major effects on functional changes during this process. The other factors which are connected with physiological development are; intellectual, social, emotional and moral development levels. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 75).

The maturation of nervous system during a foetus age is mainly guided by the genes inherited from the parents, but the childhood age development is also guided by stimu- lus created by the environment. The reproduction of the nervous cells takes place mainly in the beginning of the foetus growth and the natural development of the nerv- ous cells network slows down significantly during the first two years. When reaching six years, the nervous system has developed up to 80- 90 % of the size of an adult’s nervous system. Still the size of the brains keeps growing till puberty.

Genetic factors means that people inherit different alleles or variants of the genes that affect a trait such as muscle strength. Sev- eral studies indicate that approximately half of the variation in human muscle strength is inherited. (Cardinale, Newton & Nosaka, 2011).

During the natural g rowth of the body, the reproduction of the child’ s surface area in the muscle depends on the strain and it can multiply up to 5-10 times at the end of the growth spurt. The lower body muscles tend to grow faster, because they receive more strain than the upper body. The muscles cross surface area reaches to its natural adult size approximately at the age of 10 with the girls and by 14 with the boys. The differ- ence between the girls and the boys can be explained by the date of puberty. Girls reach the puberty usually earlier because of their hormone changes.

There is a slight difference in the skeletons maturity between boys and the girls after the birth and during the puberty the difference grows approximately to two years. The changes in the bones thickness and bones mass are strictly connected with the strain which is applied to the bone, nutrition and hormone activity. The bone mass increases strongly during the strain which is applied to the bone from longitudi- 6 nal direction at the end of preadolescent and just before puberty. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 94).

Like a bone, the tendons thickness seems to be dependent from the stain targeted to it. Tendons and ligaments take part in the strength output by stretching according the motion and returning to their resting length at the end of the motion. This allows them to reserve elastic energy and release it during the muscle contraction after the actual stretch. Elastic energy increases the motions speed and makes physical performances more economic. During the growth phase, low tempo jumping drills and elasticity ex- ercises can slightly increase the development of the muscles and tendons elastic struc- tures. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 94-95).

The lungs structural length and depth measure changes during the growth of our upper body, all the way till our growth stops. The volume of our lungs increases up to six times larger during our first year and twenty times larger when we reach adult- hood. Our lungs supporting structure elasticity increases during the growth phase, which allows more effective exhaling. This leads to a better lung ventilation and oxygen intake and enhances the exhale of carbon dioxide. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 96-97).

The hearts left ventricle is responsible for pumping 7 the blood in to our muscles and tissues. That is why its growth is dependent from the body’s strain. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 97-98). Our haemoglobin values and the quantity of red cells decrease immediately after we born, but start to increase quite fast. The increases of haemoglobin values between the genders are quite equal till reaching puberty. In the middle of puberty, bo y’s haem o- globin values increases at the level of grown man. The differences between the genders are caused by the size of our body (muscle mass), hormone actions and the menstrual cycle which causes blood lose. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 98).

It is studied that the amount of non-active peoples type I (slow & durable) muscle cells decrease and type II (fast) muscle cells increase between the age of 10 and 35. Active children do not possess that kind of strong changes, but it all depends on the child- hood’s active physical activity and the type of the activity (endurance or speed empha- sized). Children seem to have relatively more effective oxidative metabolism compared to adults, but relatively weaker glycolytic energy metabolism. So the chil dren’s muscles contain more the enzymes which are used to aerobic metabolism and cauterizing fat and adults have the enzymes to resist the lactic acids. That’s why the children’s pe r- formances are slightly more uneconomic than adults. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 99).

The muscles direct energy reserves increase from birth till adulthood up to five times larger, but the exact timetable is yet to be solved. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 100). Exercising has been discovered to have a positive effect on the previously mentioned energy reserve. The recovery of creatine phosphate reserves seems to be more effective with children than adults.

Speed is a strongly inherited quality, but it can be developed if the specific exercising is started early enough by using the sensitive periods. Speed is strictly connected with innervation, skill and strength level. These qualities should be exercised and empha- 9 sized before puberty. The exercises with preadolescent and adolescent should concen- trate on developing versatile motion thickness, reaction time and rhythm. Developing these qualities after puberty is extremely difficult, sometimes even impossible. ( Liiku n- tavammojen valtakunnallinen ehkä isyohjelma LiVE. 2009 ) .

These cate- gories apply with adults, but also with preadolescent and adolescent. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 195). First one is the stimulus and development principle which is also known as the super compensation. According to this principle the development of physical performance is based on the stimulus caused by the exercise and the recovery process which takes place afterwards. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 195). Second one is the specificity. According to this principle, only those tissues and sys- tems in the body develop which are exposed to stimulus during exercise. Practically this means that if we exercise our legs, they get stronger, if speed, then speed gets bet- ter. (Hakkar","meta":{"title":"Keskinen Markus  Final","file":"Keskinen Markus  Final.pdf"}}

Third one is the ability to recover. According to this principle our physical perfor- mance level drops back to starting level if the exercises of our tissues and body systems are stopped. Especially strength and endurance levels drop if they are not exercised constantly. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 195). Fourth one is individuality. According to this principle, the development from training is individual between every person. This appears very often among preadolescents and adolescents because of their biological development level are very different. The differ- ence can also be seen between genders, especially during puberty. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 195). Fifth and the last principle is progressiveness.

These three systems provide ATP (aden- osine triphosphate) for muscular work. (Chandler & Brown 2008). The usage of energy system can be defined by measuring the duration of the specific performance. For example; Phosphocreatine system 0-10 seconds, phosphocreatine and glycolytic system (slow) 10-30 seconds, glycolytic system (fast) 30 seconds- 2 minutes, glycolytic system (fast) and oxidative system 2-3 minutes and oxidative system < 3 minutes.

Strength output is affected by several structural and functional factors such as; amount of muscle cells, cell relationship in the muscle cells, ability of the mo- toric nervous system to activate and adjust the contraction of the muscle cells, elasticity of the muscles structures and tendons, length of the leverages, factors in the muscles energy metabolism, several hormonal regulations, exercising, gender and age.

Slow twitch (type I) and fast twitch (type II) fibres differ in force, power, velocity, rate of relaxation and fatiga- bility. There is a wide degree of variation in the proportion of fibre types in specific skeletal muscles. Also another physiological mechanism that affects muscle strength and size is the number of fibres within a given muscle. (Cardinale et al. 2011). 13 When thinking about motion, the most optimal strength output is created by the com- bination of nervous system, muscles and supportive structures. In this chain the mus- cles which cause the motion contract just at the right time, the muscles that slow down the motion give up temporarily and the supportive muscles create an optimal counter- force for the muscles which caused the motion in the beginning.

When measuring the development of strength by using isometric or isokinetic methods with the boys, the absolute strength level develops from the age of six to age between 12 and 14 in linear. After this, the strength develops strongly till reaching 20 years old. This is caused especially by the growth sprint and anabolic hormone activations.

The few reasons for this are; girls’ lower anabolic hormone levels, lower muscle and body mass, on average shorter leverages and lower adrenalin levels. With both genders the natural development of strength is at its peak approximately a year after the growth sprints peak, which is 11.4-12.2 years old with girls and 13.4-14.4 with the boys. The best period for starting to gain mass for both genders is about 1-3 years after the growth spurts peak.

Because of this, strength training should be long term and versa- tile process where different forms of strengths are exercised at the optimal time for each quality. To make the strength training programming easier, the strengths are cate- gorized into three different forms. The first from is maximum strength which can be divided into neural and hypertrophy. Second form is endurance strength which can be divided into muscle endurance and strength endurance. Third form is speed strength which can be divided into instant strength and explosive strength. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 203). When programming strength training, periodization should also be taken into consid- eration.

(Stone, Stone & Sands 2007). Macrocycles are usually described based on common-sense understanding of the na- ture of the competitions within the macrocycle. The mesocycles can be linked to form an annual plan, or a specific macrocycle. Microcycles are periods of training lasting between 7 and 14 days and they are the smallest basic unit of training planning that has strictly applied objevtives.

It is essential to concentrate on middle body muscles such as abdominals, upper and lower back, sides, buttocks and iliopsoas and their cooperation during strength output. The muscle metabolism is also a part of strength output. A child’s aerobic m etabolism is relatively good and it should be supported with muscle endurance and strength en- durance training.

Injuries might occur if the performance techniques are incorrect from the very beginning. It is crucial to learn the techniques before starting the exercises.

Key parameters include posture, nature of the movement employed, and contraction type and movement velocity. So, the strength qualities can be categorized in terms of static, concentric and eccentric modes of contraction (Gamble, P. 2013). Muscle contraction is the basis for human movement. (Stone et al. 2007). Like mentioned earlier the different forms of strengths can be divided into three cate- gories and two subcategories.

Memory is the result from learning, or in other words stored changes in our neural circuit’s abilities. (Sandström & Ahonen 2011, 65).

Athletes’ learn unconsciously things during supervised training situations. The aim might be learning a new technique, but the athlete might learn something new about group dy- namics. This learning style is called hidden syllabus. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 237-238). 4.2 The modern style of learning a skill The modern style of learning says that the learning develops through three factors and their cooperative actions which are the learner, the learning environment and the actual skill or task.

Usually the supervisor or coach leads the athlete through the drill by talking, some- times other methods are used like writing notes. Instruction usually include the most necessary information about the subject which is practiced and it can focus on several different objectives, for example team work, technique, tactics or result.

Our short lasting memory has a very limited capacity to receive information. That’s why the given instructions should only include few main objectives and the 19 speech should be given just before the athle tes’ performance. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 339-340).

The visual picture teaches the athlete usually more than a thousand words. Demonstration can be handed out by the coach, pictures or even videos, and during the practice sessions, the athletes’ gain plenty of demonstration from each other. (Hakkarainen et al. 2009, 341). During the demonstration, it is essential that the coach is placed correct. The coach must be certain, that all the athletes’ can see and hear the demonstration.

If watching the at h- lete him/herself, the most efficient way to learn is by watching the best pictures or vid- eos. If the athlete cannot locate the errors in the performance, the coach should advice the athlete verbally and ask questions about the main objectives. This increases the ath letes’ observation skills. Demonstrations have been noticed to be the most effective in the beginning of the learning and at the later phases also.

It is time to move to the barbell, after mastering the movements with the stick. Using free-weight barbells requires higher levels of motor coordination than using ma- chines. The freedom of movement allowed by free weights easily translates to potential injury when correct loading, lifting and spotting techniques are not used. However, free weight training is not dangerous; when reasonable precautions are taken, it is very safe and usually more effective than machines in strengthening the body.

The in- creased hip activation will lead to a stronger pull and squat. More stability means that you will have a very consistent platform from which to push. (Stadtfeld 2012). Weight lifting shoes have a wooden sole, which means your foot is going to consistent- ly be on a stable surface. The wooden sole raises the heel up usually between 1.8- 2.5 cm, depending on your shoes. This allows you to utilize every aspect of your muscula- ture for the lift you are practicing. The higher heel also allows you to squat deeper po- sition due to the increased range of motion for the ankle joint.

Muscles which have both functions are called hybrid muscles. Today people do not have correctly only tonic or phasic muscles. Some muscles can still be categorised between the two by seeing how they react to incorrect loading or overwork. (Spring et al. 1986, 120-124).

When the muscles activate during the warm up, capillaries open and stays that way and the blood circulation increases. Increased blood circulation and the activated muscles create heath inside of the muscles and inside your body. Because of this, your muscles get more oxygen, energy and hormones, and the metabolic waste exits from your mus- cles. All these combined improve the performance and recovery of your muscles. (Saari et al. 2009, 3).

My employer for this pro- ject was Kalle Kettunkangas from KJT (Keskiuudenmaan jääkiekko tuki) and we came to a conclusion that it should strictly include only weightlifting techniques and the main principles which help our young athletes. I also had a meeting with Katariina 28 Vestman, and we together decided the most important information included with the manual which are connected with weightlifting and adolescent children. After all the correct lifting techniques and movements are covered, the written part of the manual starts. The written part is divided into chapters which include important information about cooling down, stretching, healthy eating and quality sleeping.

The athletes seen in the manual are I and Kimmo Korvenoja, who is one of Katariina Vestman’s weightlifting students. I picked Kimmo to perform some of the move- ments, because I am not able to execute them with perfect technique. There are total of ten movements and I am featuring in five of them and Kimmo the other five. The safety procedures are mentioned before every technique and the movement is gone through step by step before the pictures. All the lifts are shown from the side-view, because side- view shows the body’s movement best. 7.3 Project assessment I was very pleased with the outcome of my manual.

I also wanted that all the athletes from dif- ferent sports can use this weightlifting manual as a guide to help them to get started with pure classic weightlifting training. The main concern of this project was building the manual. The manual is booklet type of paper document which includes all the text and pictures.

After controlling the basics of the two Olympic lifts, it is time to start exercising the strengthening movements. 8.1 Stick gymnastics Stick gymnastics is used during warm up and the objective is to activate and warm up your muscles by using versatile and useful movements. While practicing the techniques with the stick, your muscles and joints open up because of the continuous rotations and trajectory’s made with you r body. You can also practice the correct lifting tech- niques and movements safe, because there is no resistance at all.

I have presented the most important and useful lifts for the beginners and even an ad- vanced weightlifter can rehearse his skills by reading the manual. The athlete should first learn the basics of the two Olympic lifts through stick gymnastics, so the move- ments become smooth and technical. After mastering the basics of the Olympic lifts the athlete should start the strengthening movements which allow him to gain more mobility, motoric skills, flexibility and most importantly strength.

As the body adapts to the movements, the athlete can start adding light weights to the barbell. I chose the lifts together with Katariina Vestman and they are used in almost every sport where strength training exists. When talking about strength training among athletes, they are often being shy about weightlifting and especially the Olympic techniques. My goal is to get the athletes and coaches in different sports more open minded for classic weightlifting techniques, be- cause they build up and strengthen our body balanced. Another important goal for me is to gather more adolescent children towards weightlifting, because the once great Finnish weightlifting culture is almost gone.

After I took a few pure classic weightlifting lessons from Kimmo Korvenoja, I was immediately hooked. The motion, movement and technique look so easy to perform, but when taking a closer look, you understand that the Olympic weightlifting tech- niques are one of the most demanding and technical performances that exists. That 44 fact fascinated me and I immediately wanted adolescent children and other athletes to recognize this.

{"text":"er, nowadays the knowledge and information about safety procedures and correct lift- ing technique has perished, not only weightlifting, but all the movements and tech- niques which are possible to perform in the gym. I wanted to change that as soon as possible with my manual. Athletes and coaches should use this weightlifting manual as guidance for their next step in strength training, no matter what the sport is. It is impossible to reach perfection, but it is not about the distance and destination, it is all about the journey. The healthier and better lifestyle begins immediately when you start practicing classic weightlifting. The results will come as you practice and exercise enough. Demand more from yourself and for the athletes you may coach. Always re- member that technique beats power every time, and weightlifting is all about technique. 45 Bibliography Arvonen, S., & Kailajärvi, J. 2002 Suomalainen ryhtiliike ry.

{"text":"Motivation and Social Support in Weightlifting: A Coach’s Perspective By William Rand May 25, 2018 Ab s t r a c t This narrative review examines the benefits of motivational support in sports and academically related skills. The purpose of the review is to explore the results of social and professional influences on classroom and athletic endeavors. Many, but certainly not all, individuals come to the gym or classroom motivated to improve themselves. Their initial motivation may or may not be strong. This article takes a coaching perspective in examining social and technical effects on the development and nurturing of motivation through positive and negative input from coaches, teachers and family. The review forms a comparative investigation of social motivation; however, the primary focus is on serious weightlifting.

They may notice partners, couples or football teams working out together, but, for the most part, they see lifters slam the iron in their solitary routines, each closed within his or her own specific objectives, similar to the way they think of writers. Athletes do and should motivate themselves is a common belief. That may work for some of the athletes, some of the time. In my experience, a majority of athletes, whether they admit it or not, live more akin to John Donne‘s words: ―No man is an island, entire of itself.‖ 2 Mike Clancy says, ― Even the most educated and experienced health professional utilizes some sort of social support‖ (Par.6).

She had only a basic desire to share an activity with me and perhaps to improve her physical condition and reduce her job related stress a bit. She showed no clear motivation beyond what teachers refer to as achieving the minimum passing grade, but she demonstrated a lot of physical potential.

That may sound like a personal problem, something athletes should have when they enter the gym or should build on their own. So, how does motivation relate to coaching? ―Simply, the coach‘s role is to create the environment and to provide the opportunity for the athlete to express their motivation in all that they do‖ (Goldsmith 38). A solid text to begin study of the concept is Aiden P. Moran‘s book Sport and Exercise Psychology: A Critical Introduction, 2004.

For a more weightlifting specific text, one, among many, must read (I hate that term, although relevant here) book is The Poliquin Principles (1997) by Charles Poliquin. Poliquin is a well-known coach renown for using weightlifting techniques to help not only those in the elite levels of the iron sports but other athletes earn medals in Olympic sports such as track and speed skating.

It‘s also been my experience that these individuals (dare we call them athletes?) tend to rush between heavy sets to maintain a high heart rate‖ (33). There is controversy everywhere. An excellent book focused on nutrition is Everything You Need to Know about Fat Loss (1997) by Chris Aceto. The title is a bit restrictive because it covers more than just fat loss. The book has sections on carbohydrates, protein and fat, as well as insulin resistance, thermogenesis, eating habits and exercise. Many articles (see References ) suggest personal motivational strategies such as setting small goals, finding a good workout partner, watching motivational videos, etcetera, all good ideas.

Jim Taylor‘ s article also lists some of these motivational strategies, including a discussion of the concept of The Grind , the point where many potential athletes quit. A very significant article is Michael Berg‘s profile of RSP-sponsored athlete Kieon Dorsey. Berg says, ―Kieon Dorsey is living proof of what can be accomplished through sheer will and hard work‖ (1).

Similarly, a writing teacher formally educated in grammar, structure, literature and style who has also published can teach the skill better than one who only holds a degree. I have seen this personally many times from both sides of the classroom, as it were.

Finally, experience or research in the psychological aspects of training, the focus of this article, is important. The necessary psychological attribute of motivation arises from several factors such as confidence, encouragement, positive social feedback, discipline, focus, and education. Coaching helps with these factors. However, more is needed. “Creativity is the defining difference between good coaches and great coaches” (Goldsmith, Ten Habits Par. 11). This creative dynamic is needed to instill or enhance these psychological factors by getting untrained athletes or students to first believe in themselves, and then to set standards higher than they thought possible. One of the coach‘s jobs is to nurture that belief and to know what the athlete or student can do — - short of injury or embarrassment — -and to coax that level of performance from the athlete","meta":{"title":"Motivation_and_Social_Support_in_Weightl","file":"Motivation_and_Social_Support_in_Weightl.pdf"}}
{"text":"to know what the athlete or student can do — - short of injury or embarrassment — -and to coax that level of performance from the athlete or student. For coaches to instill that belief takes honest confidence in the athlete or student and reachable challenges. Few if any novice lifters are going to squat double bodyweight for reps or look like Ronnie Coleman or Cory Everson in a couple of months, and many beginners see such goals as unreachable in any event. Believing in the possibilities of the process represents an important first step. The following case studies explore the effects of positive and negative feedback with a creative focus on improving the motivation and performance of athletes in the gym.

In my experience, many of my university colleagues held a low opinion of sports in general and of athletes in particular (not counting a philosophy professor who lifted with me once in a while at the university gym back in Colorado.

Most of them did through rising confidence gained by shifting priorities, encouragement and resultant hard work. Two techniques in particular helped. For the first, I tried to teach by example.

Even casual competition boosts motivation . You may find that a lot of people do not associate the concept of hard work with exercise and fitness. They think of their gym time as a casual hobby, like shooting pool or planting flowers, and that a quick, sweaty circuit of twenty or thirty repetitions for each exercise will quickly cut fat and build muscle.

Prospective athletes must be shown that intense effort translates to focus on the workout and lifting heavy weight.

Ronnie Coleman , eight-time Mr. Olympia , says, ‖There‘s no secret formula. I lift heavy, work hard, and aim to be the best‖ (Scotti, Par. 4). Prospective athletes must learn through coaching and direct observation that results don‘t come easily or quickly. In his West Coast Offense Playbook, C oach Bill Walsh says: ―Don‘t be afraid to work hard, and don‘t be afraid to fail. We want you to play smart, but also play hard!‖ (10).

At that time, all composition students at the university were responsible for learning fifteen points of English grammar for their essays. The football players complained that the list was too hard; they couldn‘t d o it. Their attitudes were negative and defeatist from the start.

The student had the desire to succeed, or he would not have come to my office. Also, he seemed quite intelligent, so I was perplexed. In my conversation with the student, I learned that his adviser had declared him mentally disabled because he was bilingual and his native language was Spanish. Once I controlled my rage, I told him that I was studying Spanish, including grammar, and I asked if he thought that I was trying to become disabled. He blinked at that and shook his head. I invited him to come to my office twenty minutes before every class. We worked on his grammar. Within a month, his grades were above 85% and climbing weekly.

I have noted a tendency — not an absolute, but a strong tendency — to allow a goal or challenge to become a limitation. In my experiences as a lifter and a coach, I have watched people set a goal in a lift of, say, ten repetitions. I have noted when lifters, myself included, sat on the bench or setup under the squat bar and focused on those ten reps. Perhaps the lifter achieved six, eight or the full ten reps. Good. However, it is a rare thing for the lifter to get eleven reps. The goal of ten reps has essentially become a limitation of ten reps. A better, more confident, mindset, when a maximum of ten reps is envisioned, might be to try for as many reps as possible or perhaps to shoot for twelve reps. It becomes a mind game.

The day‘s goal may be ten reps or whatever at that set, but with a little mental imagery under the bar, the lifter may just be able to beat the ten rep ceiling or hit that super heavy, pre- competition triple. In the United States, I had a friend who, when I was a week or two out of a powerlifting competition, could talk me into making a heavy squat triple. He sat beside me as I wrapped my knees and told me how strong I was and how light the weight was until I felt so motivated and confident that the lift went with no problem.

Unfortunately, as is usually the case, the early negative feedback from my wife‘s family members seemed more forceful for a time, specifically in the first six months of our program. Marbella‘s budding motivation and productivity suffered as she frequently asked me if a given exercise could cause her bones to break. It is difficult for anyone to lift with intensity toward achieving any goal when fearful of breaking bones or getting a hernia. The issue of negative feedback and induced fear becomes relevant because support from family and friends is important in building and maintaining motivation in an activity as time and labor intensive as bodybuilding. ―Support from family and significant others at ‗key‘ transitional phases (such as changing schools","meta":{"title":"Motivation_and_Social_Support_in_Weightl","file":"Motivation_and_Social_Support_in_Weightl.pdf"}}

In light of her apprehensions about the other stronger lifters around her and especially the lack of immediate familial support, motivation was one of my prime concerns.

Those who show up for every workout are less likely to backslide. ― The secret to maintaining consistency is having a social system.

Give lifters a taste of competition. Education does not work well without broader experience in which to use it, however. At my (younger) level, both personally and as a college level varsity coach, I found that the best motivational experience comes from competition. How does a coach instill that type of experience in novice athletes? One effective method of increasing motivation is intra-gym competition. Organization in a meet-like setting is effective but time consuming, somewhat expensive and not crucial (another lesson I learned through experience).

To boost motivation (and add a bit of fun to the workouts), my coaches created a competitive atmosphere by inventing numeric handicaps to account for varied experience levels or took weight percentages to adjust for body weight differentials. For a simple example: if two lifters of different body weights trained together and performed the same exercise at the same weight for the same number of reps, the lighter lifter is obviously stronger. The motivational effect proved significant. We apply the concept in a similar manner now when Marbella and I train together. We simplify everything to reps. When we do an exercise, she has her weight on the bar, dumbbells or machine, and I have mine. We usually have the same goal reps, but whoever manages the most reps wins.

Results My wife Marbella started weightlifting as a 42 year old novice with a low level of motivation and no previous athletic experience. Over the course of her first two years of training, she experienced both positive and negative social feedback.

Over the two- year period, Marbella‘s motivation and confidence have risen to what can be considered good for a high-level lifter, and her gym performance improved dramatically. In one family outing in a restaurant, Marbella also demonstrated the positive effects that motivated weightlifting can produce in one‘s life outside the gym. In a conversation about lifting, Marbella said to her sister that one of the best results of training with me is that she now has the confidence to try things that she previously thought she could not do.

My accumulated experiences and my wife‘s case study strongly suggest that positive or negative social feedback can affect athletic or academic performance and results to a significant degree in many individuals, especially novices and underachievers. Many such athletes or students go unnoticed until they ask for assistance or actually produce something. Few ask, and production is often difficult without external inspiration. I try to teach by example and with encouragement here where we train. That occas ionally helps. Sometimes, someone will ask, ―What is that exercise for?‖ or ―What is that stuff you two drink between sets?‖ However, the lifter asking is generally already in fairly good or above average condition.

The designed model has an advantage in respect to saving time for qualifying beginners for powerlifting classes compared to the common methodology when the qualification process takes several months of training. Using the suggested technique, one can allocate the most perspective candidates for powerlifting classes in the very beginning of the academic year. 2. The subjected model of qualification and training of powerlifters ensures selecting sports actions with beginners in respect to their weight categories with a specific goal, estimating the intensity of work, promoting individualizing the load intensity for every athlete and efficient competitive performance already during the first year of training.

{"text":"signing time-efficient train- ing programs can therefore be valuable to increasing par- ticipation and adherence to a strength training program [2]. Many well-trained athletes divide their training into multiple weekly training sessions, particularly during periods of high training load and/or volume [4]. It is theorized that briefer, more frequent weekly training sessions might allow for training with greater training loads compared to less frequent sessions of a longer duration due to maximal energy utilization and reduced fatigue during exercise [4]. Beyond a given threshold, the quality of training begins to degrade as session duration increases [5].

Proper manipulation of load, volume, rest and frequency is essential to improve muscular hypertrophy and muscle strength [7–11]. However, training frequency may be the variable that has gained the least attention and thus requires further investiga- tion [12, 13]. Training frequency is typically defined as either the total number of weekly resistance training sessions, or the number of times a given muscle group is trained per week [7, 12–17]. Previously, several studies have exam- ined the effects of different strength training frequen- cies on muscular adaptations and muscle strength [1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 19]. The majority of these studies have compared muscle group frequency and not session fre- quency. Few studies have examined the effects of session frequency on muscular adaptations [4, 6, 18, 19].

[6] reported greater maximal strength increases in the biceps curl (1-RM) in the group performing a split- body routine (four weekly sessions), and a lower 12-RM knee flexion strength and leg muscle mass in the group performing a total-body routine (two weekly sessions). Nevertheless, there are some methodological issues in the abovementioned studies that need to be adressed. For example the majority of these studies had small sample sizes (five to ten subjects per group) [4, 19] and relatively short intervention periods (3–8 weeks) [4, 18, 19]. It has been suggested that women respond differently to resistance training frequency than men [13]. A meta- analysis by Grgic et al. [13] showed that women are more likely to respond more positively to a higher training fre- quency compared to men.

Further, few of the studies comparing differ- ent frequencies with equated training volumes have used non-resistance trained individuals as participants [20]. Consequently it would be of interest to compare resist- ance training programs with different training frequen- cies among non-resistance trained women to strengthen research-based recommendations for training.

We hypothesized that the SPLIT group would increase muscle mass and maximal strength more than the FB group because shorter sessions could be performed at a higher intensity, resulting in increased total volume load over time. However, no differences were observed between groups in either total training volume, or when dividing the volume load into upper- and lower body components. The lack of difference in training volume load between the groups may explain our findings.

Importantly, Hartman et al. [4] did not find an increase in maximal strength, which could explain the lack of improvement in jump height.

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the effects of dif- ferent session frequencies on explosive characteristics in the upper body. The present study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. First, participants had little to no resistance training experience. It has previously been demonstrated that untrained individuals often respond well to all train- ing programs regardless of training frequency [3, 32, 33]. Conceivably, training frequency may become more important when people gain experience in resistance training.

Third, the session frequency in FB was 50% less than in SPLIT, and in Ribeiro et al. [19] the difference between the two groups was 33%. It is possible that greater contrasts (e.g. two vs. six sessions/ week) are needed to elicit a difference. Fourth, although we instructed participants to maintain their usual and customary diets throughout the study period, we did not exert direct control over their nutritional intake. Although this raises the possibility that body composi- tion data may have been confounded by dietary altera- tions, the relatively large sample size together with the fact that the groups were randomized, would seemingly have cancelled out any resulting differences between groups.

INTRODUCTION: Biomechanical characteristics of weightlifting (in both snatch and clean & jerk) have been studied for a decade. Studies have specifically focused on barbell path in relation to body position, barbell velocity, and mechanical work and power output (Barton, 1997; Gourgoulis, Aggeloussis, Mavromatis, & Garas, 2000; Gourgoulis, Aggeloussis, Kalivas, Antoniou, & Mavromatis, 2004; Haff, et al., 2003; Isaka, Okada, & Funato, 1996; Schilling, et al., 2002; Stone, O’Bryant, Williams, Pierce, & Johnson, 1998).

{"text":"& Funato, 1996; Schilling, et al., 2002; Stone, O’Bryant, Williams, Pierce, & Johnson, 1998). The primary intention of analyzing both kinematic and kinetic variables was to distinguish the difference between a good and bad lift, and analyze the typical lifting techniques of elite weightlifters. However, Stone et al. (2006) concluded that based on these biomechanical variables, it is difficult to predict a perfect lifting technique that is accepted by all weightlifters. For example, it is commonly thought that the barbell path should be close to the body and relatively S- shaped throughout the lift. But some studies reported different barbell paths among some elite weightlifters (Hiskia, 1997). Based on the reviews, the barbell path seems to vary by individual depending on different anthropometric measurement and lifting preference. Another example is that a fast barbell velocity is thought to be a characteristic of good and strong lifters (Gourgoulis et al., 2004; Haff","meta":{"title":"sarahclarke,+3247-7541-1-CE","file":"sarahclarke,+3247-7541-1-CE.pdf"}}

However, the fast barbell velocity requires lifters to squat down quickly to be in the catch position, which may lead to an unsuccessful lift. It is questionable to conclude that the faster barbell velocity is a good indication of a successful lift. Rather, the fast barbell velocity may be just one’s lifting style. The barbell velocity should be reviewed more carefully in future studies. Even though the biomechanics of weightlifting have been a well-studied subject, a report of barbell acceleration is limited to only three studies, and no discussion was made regarding the interpretation of the barbell acceleration graph and table in their studies (Gourgoulis, et al., 2000; Haff, et al., 2003; Isaka, et al., 1996).

{"text":"is, et al., 2000; Haff, et al., 2003; Isaka, et al., 1996). Specifically, the present study focused on the peak barbell acceleration during the 2 nd pull phase. The 2 nd pull phase is a critical part of the lift to determine whether the barbell is being pulled up to the desired height to catch (Stone, et al., 2006). Furthermore, acceleration is directly proportional to force production while mass is a constant value. Thus, when a barbell increases its rate of velocity, the body is producing the force to accelerate the barbell to an upward direction. This acceleration measurement can be a valuable assessment for weightlifters and other athletes, and it is necessary to examine how various intensities change the peak barbell acceleration. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine how various intensity levels influence the peak barbell acceleration in weightlifting.

METHODS : Participants: Men’s and women’s weightlifting resident team members at Colorado Springs Olympic Training Center participated in this study (see Table 1). They were free of injuries at the time of data collection. They were also in the middle of their strength development phase leading up to the competition. Data were collected in compliance with policies of the United States Olympic Committee on the testing of athletic subjects.

They had an adequate amount of stretching and warm-up in a similar fashion as they normally do before the training session. A 3-axis accelerometer (PS-2119, Pasco Scientific, Roseville, CA) was used to measure the barbell acceleration, and was attached to a Bluetooth™ wireless device (Pasco Pasport Airlink SI (PS-2005)). The total weight of the unit is 170.1 grams, which is equivalent to a plastic barbell collar. Thus, the weight of the accelerometer should not interrupt a lifter’s ability to sense asymmetry of weight between the left and right sides of the barbell.

In order to minimize the external shock when the lifter drops the barbell, the foam unit was designed to secure the accelerometer (see Figure 1). The accelerometer unit was attached to the end of the barbell. It is important to note that the orientation of the sensor must remain in the constant position throughout the lift to avoid misrepresentation of the resultant acceleration. Therefore, the unit was securely attached directly below the barbell (see Figure 2).

{"text":"nd pull phase reaches near maximal level around 85% of 1RM. In other words, the force production remains relatively the same while the peak acceleration decreases and the mass of the barbell increases. The main training intensity during the strength development phase is between 80 to 90% of 1RM (Baechle, & Earle, 2008). These results showed that roughly 80% of 1RM is the threshold for the elite level weightlifters to be able to maintain the peak barbell acceleration. A resultant acceleration was calculated in this study even though the other studies reported linear vertical acceleration (Gourgoulis, et al., 2000; Haff, et al., 2003). Measuring the resultant acceleration was believed to be appropriate since the 2 nd pull phase is not typically a linear fashion. Rather, the 2 nd pull phase of the barbell path is displayed in curvilinear in many studies (Gourgoulis et al., 2000; Gourgoulis et al., 2004; Haff et al., 2003; Isaka, et al., 1996).

(1996) that the 2 nd pull phase exerted the highest barbell acceleration value. In this study, all participants were experienced and elite level in this sport. Participants were a mix of female and male weightlifters. The difference in the peak barbell acceleration between the genders was not observed. In future studies, it would be appropriate to compare this data with beginner level weightlifters (mainly in youth) and other athletes who require power components in their sports to identify how intensity level influences the barbell acceleration.

First, attempting the maximal weight is one way to measure how athletes are improving the strength over the long-term training, but tracking the peak barbell acceleration can be another useful assessment to observe progression of the peak acceleration values which equal to the progression of force production capability. Another benefit is that when tracking the peak barbell acceleration throughout a single training session, significant decrease in the acceleration value in later stage of the training session can be an indicator of fatigue (less force is being produced to accelerate the barbell). If the lifter continues to lift after the fatigue sets in, it may lead to over-training/over-use injuries.

{"text":". If the lifter continues to lift after the fatigue sets in, it may lead to over-training/over-use injuries. Describing and identifying fatigue is sensitive and difficult, but the barbell acceleration test may be a suitable assessment to create a better communication environment to re-evaluate the training program between coaches and athletes. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study tested the peak value of the barbell acceleration at the 2 nd pull phase of weightlifting with three different intensity levels. The peak barbell acceleration decreased as the intensity level increased. Since this study was conducted with elite level weightlifters, comparing the data with beginners or other power-typed athletes would be interesting to examine how various intensity levels influence the barbell acceleration.

Any dietary deficiency that adversely affects the health of the individual is likely to impair his or her physical performance capacity and thus nutrition and wellbeing assumes a vital role in the field of sports. The consequence of extremely prolonged exercise is huge energy expenditure and the subsequent nutrient loss and therefore athletes must be continuously supplied with adequate nutrients, to maintain their optimum nutritional wellbeing.

While ADLs vary from person to person, you can also consider activities such as push-ups, pull-ups, and carrying heavy objects to be ADLs. FLEXIBILITY: To some degree, your flexibility determines the efficiency of your muscles. Increased flexibility has also been associated with decreased risk of acute and chronic (overuse) injuries. Poor flexibility can directly affect cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, and muscular endurance. Physiologically, flexibility can include extra muscular factors, such as range of motion at a joint, as well as intramuscular factor, such as hyper tonicity (knots) within the muscles themselves.

INTRODUCTION: Yogic Pranayama has attained tremendous significance in the new age because Pranayam improves breathing. This is very much benefiting long life as well as for good health. Briefly, it can be said that Pranayama means control of breath in a systematic manner. It has been observed that a “student or athlete who wants to learn Pranayama and continue pracatising it needs to have a clear idea regarding its scope and limits.

There is evidence in the Yogic literature that relaxation Shavasan and Pranayama are helpful to increase the efficiency of respiratory and circulatory organs. THE CONCEPT OF YOGA: Swami Satya Prakash has rightly observed that, it is a common practice to derive Sanskrit terms from their roots, for example, Yoga from Yuj, to join, to Yoke, to combine together, or to bring together. And hence the term YOGA conveys the sense of union. 4 The athletes can also improve his good health by unifying with super power and by deriving energy from him.

This has increased the tension and serious problems in all walks of life and sports is also not an exception to this. On this background a new approach has been presented here. THE SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO YOGA: The word Yoga is derived from the Sanskrit word “Yuj” meaning “to unite”, “to combine” or “to integrate” and thus may be considered to refer to a “state of union or integration”. Yoga is generally understood as the union of the individual soul with the cosmic, divine or supreme soul that constitutes the ultimate fulfillment of human being.

The second part is known as Sadhna Pada- which includes the means of attaining communion containing 55 sutras. The third one is described as Vibhuti pada, which means power, or perfections containing 55 sutras and the fourth and last is given title as Kaivalya pada which means isolation, which included 34 sutras.

INTRODUCTION : The conceptual background of yoga has its origins in ancient Indian philosophy. There are numerous modern schools or types of yoga (i.e., Iyengar, Viniyoga, Sivananda, etc.), each having its own distinct emphasis regarding the relative content of physical postures and exercises (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), deep relaxation, and meditation practices that cultivate awareness and ultimately more profound states of consciousness. The application of yoga as a therapeutic intervention, which began early in the twentieth century, takes advantage of the various psychophysiological benefits of the component practices.

The physical exercises (asanas) may increase patient’s physical flexibility, coordination, and strength, while the breathing practices and meditation may calm and focus the mind to develop greater awareness and diminish anxiety, and thus result in higher quality of life. Other beneficial effects might involve a reduction of distress, blood pressure, and improvements inresilience, mood, and metabolic regulation. Khalsa stated that a majority of the research on yoga as a therapeutic intervention was conducted in India and a significant fraction of these were published in Indian journals, some of which are difficult to acquire for Western clinicians and researchers. In their bibliometric analysis from 2004,they found that 48% of the enrolled studies were uncontrolled, while 40% were randomized clinical trials (RCT),and 12% non-RCT (N-RCT).

For many specific indications and conditions, there is inconsistent evidence with several studies reporting positive effects of the yoga interventions, but other studies are less conclusive.

For those studies that included cancer patients ( n = 10), the treatment effect of yoga was 0.20 (0.15–0.24); for all other studies that did not include cancer patients ( n = 9), the effect was 0.46 (0.24–0.67).

Nevertheless, there is currently insufficient data on contraindications or side effects related to yoga practices in patients with psychological disorders.Taken together, while several reviews suggest positive benefits of yoga, various methodological limitations (including small sample sizes, heterogeneity of controls and interventions) limit the generalizability of these promising study findings. It is quite likely that yoga may help to improve patient self-efficacy, self-competence, physical fitness, and group support, and may well be effective as a supportive adjunct to mitigate medical conditions, but not yet as a proven stand-alone, curative treatment.

Regular physical activity participation throughout childhood provides immediate health benefits, by positively effecting body composition and musculo-skeletal development (Malina and Bouchard, 1991), and reducing the presence of coronary heart disease risk factors (Gutin et al., 1994). In recognition of these health benefits, physical activity guidelines for children and youth have been developed by the Health Education Authority [now Health Development Agency (HDA)] (Biddle et al., 1998). The primary recommendation advocates the accumulation of 1 hour's physical activity per day of at least moderate intensity (i.e. The equivalent of brisk walking), through lifestyle, recreational and structured activity forms.

Moreover, it is possible that the lack of policy, curriculum development or teacher expertise in this area contributes to the considerable variation in physical activity levels during PE (Stratton, 1996a). However, objective research evidence suggests that this is mainly due to differences in pedagogical variables [i.e. Class size, available space, organizational strategies, teaching approaches, lesson content, etc. (Borys, 1983; Stratton, 1996a)]. Furthermore, PE activity participation may be influenced by inter-individual factors.

Valuing both shows that person A is the one who remains physically active, because person B showed one recovery fewer than the number of lapses occurred. The advantages of this approach are as follows: First, lapses and recoveries stem from individual data. The lapse–recovery relationship describes the behaviour of a given person but could also be analyzed on a group level without depending on other person's physical activity patterns (i.e., the study sample).

It was practiced 25 centuries ago by Gotama the Buddha, who said he had rediscovered a much older practice. After his enlightenment in 528 BCE, the Buddha spent the remaining 45 years of his life teaching the way out of suffering. Vipassana is the essence of what he taught. The Buddha’s teaching is known by the general term Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma). For five centuries Vipassana helped millions of people in India, the Buddha’s homeland. This era saw the matchless reign of the great EmperorAsoka (273-236 BCE) who united India and initiated a golden age of peace and prosperity.Asoka also sent ambassadors of Dhamma to all the neighboring kingdoms (including what has become Myanmar in modern times), thereby spreading both the practice and the words of the Buddha.

Fortunately it was maintained by a continuous chain of meditation teachers in the neighboring country ofMyanmar (Burma) until the present day.In our time, Vipassana has been reintroduced to India and to people from all over the world byS. N. Goenka, a retired industrialist of Indian heritage who was born in Myanmar. He learned the technique of Vipassana from Sayagyi U Ba Khin, the renowned lay Vipassana teacher who was the first to teach westerners in English. U Ba Khin appointed him to teach Vipassana in 1969.

Scientific Law of Vipassana Meditation The scientific laws that operate one&#39;s thoughts, feelings, judgements and sensations become clear. Through direct experience, the nature of how one grows or regresses, how one produces suffering or frees oneself from suffering is understood. Life becomes characterized by increased awareness, non- delusion, self-control and peace.

Although Indian by descent, the current teacher in this chain, Mr. S.N. Goenka, was born and raised in Burma (Myanmar). While living there he had the good fortune to learn Vipassana from his teacher, Sayagyi U Ba Khin who was at the time a high Government official. After receiving training from his teacher for fourteen years, Mr. Goenka settled in India and began teaching Vipassana in 1969. Since then he has taught tens of thousands of people of all races and all religions in both the East and West. In 1982 he began to appoint assistant teachers to help him meet the growing demand for Vipassana courses.

In the long run, Yoga can even aid anyone to fight depression, maintain a positive self-image and positive outlook towards life in general, and help in developing high willpower and tolerance (towards self and others).

Furthermore, these drastic measures also make it so much easier to be sedentary at home for long periods of time.

Physical activity improves common chronic conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 (i.e.Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes). Physical activity is a great stress management tool by reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Physical activity helps bring cortisol levels in balance.

This article explores teaching progressions to help coaches periodize weightlifting training for young or novice athletes, with consideration to the theoretical concepts underpinning long-term ath- letic development. It is hoped that the structured and progressive guidelines presented in the current article will help coaches develop the weightlifting performance of their young athletes in a safe and effective manner. INTRODUCTION W eightlifting is a sport where the snatch and the clean and jerk are contested. In weightlifting competitions, athletes have 3 attempts to lift the maximum amount of weight in both lifts; with athletes placing within their respec- tive bodyweight class as determined by the sum of the highest completed lift for both movements.

Some of the highest absolute and relative peak power outputs reported in the liter- ature have been achieved in the weightlifting movements, with national lifters producing a relative peak power output of 55.8 Watts/ kg (6981 W/125 kg) during the second pull of the clean (54). Power outputs for athletes of similar body- weights have been found to be 2 to 3 times higher in the weightlifting movements than in squats and deadlifts (55). Maximum strength, identified as squat one repetition maximum (1RM), and peak power output derived from vertical jumping have been found to strongly corre- late with weightlifting performance among national-level male and female lifters (21). Such findings highlight the importance of maximal force and rate of force development for weightlifting performance.

THE TRANSFERENCE OF WEIGHTLIFTING Although the superior power output of weightlifters may be related to sport-selection factors, it is also likely to be the result of long-term adaptations to the type of training programs that they are exposed to (51,53,68). Considering the high strength and power expression dur- ing the competitive weightlifting movements (51,53,70), weightlifting training methods are commonly used to develop and improve physical qualities required in many sports (59,64,67,71). Such benefits are espe- cially transferable to explosive move- ments such as sprinting and jumping (21). Furthermore, performance of Address correspondence to Stephanie J.

When individuals are at an age at which they can follow coaching instructions and handle the attention demands of a training program (99), weightlifting techniques should be a focus of early interventions, to acquire competent technical skill in the early stages of development (2). Lifting max- imal loads should not be a training goal as the athlete develops weightlifting lit- eracy.

However, poor technique during the lifts could lead to athletes being exposed to undesirable and potentially dangerous positions under load, increasing the risk of injury.

The degrees of freedom concept in motor learning suggests that there are multi- ple ways in which muscles, joints, and limb segments may vary in position and movement to achieve the same goal (12). Expanding on this concept, Newell’s dynamic systems theory pro- poses that movement is produced from the interaction of multiple subsystems within the person, task, and environ- ment, and motor system degrees of freedom can reorganize over time in the long-term development of a move- ment skill (102). Dynamic systems the- ory suggests that during this early stage of learning, the athlete is creating a coordinative structure; the subsystems come together and interact in a specific way to produce the most efficient, task- specific, movement solution that would not be not obtainable by any of the subsystems alone.

For young athletes, competition-based games may still be incorporated into training drills with no load to enhance enjoyment and effort, for example, rac- ing a partner to drop into a front squat catch position. The athlete should first be able to demonstrate technical pro- ficiency with a light resistance such as a wooden dowel or PVC piping, then progress to light barbells (5–10 kg) then to appropriate weightlifting bars (males 20 kg and females 15 kg). Com- petitive games and challenges can be played when the athletes are perform- ing the movements with no external load, adding a fun element to training; for example, marbles can be sealed inside the PVC pipes so the young ath- letes can make a noise with them (93) and athletes can race to drop into a catch position on command.

With advanced lifters, supramaximal loads may also be used when the movement is broken down into key phases, such as 120% of clean 1RM for pull to the knee. However, exercises with different intensities should still be used, with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics National Olympic team reportedly per- forming only 42% of their total lifting volume above 80% of 1RM during a preparatory training year (130). During postpuberty, this increase in intensity aligns with current recommendations, which suggest that at this stage of mat- uration, athletic potential is best devel- oped through increases in external load (87), often accompanied by a reduction in training volume (106).

However, contrary to this intuition, although most lifters use similar technical styles of lifting, there is often high inter- individual variability in the barbell trajec- tories and kinematic or kinetic characteristics of weightlifting move- ments among highly skilled athletes (3,7,8,14).

Instead of adopting stringent technical models, an alternative approach is to use key performance indicators (Table 3). Notwithstanding the importance of coach instruction and safe technique, adopting a somewhat less rigid instruc- tional approach encourages the athlete to search for their own effective coordina- tion solution (32,102). Effective task constraints provide the athlete with immediate information on the quality of the movement, termed knowledge of performance, while pro- viding an external focus of attention (115,125). For example, the athlete can gain feedback from contacting an obstruction such as a wooden dowel, if the bar path deviates away from its optimal bar path (Table 4) .

A constraints-based approach to coaching also allows individuals to find movement solutions based on unchangeable individual constraints, such as limb length, rather than trying to mold an athlete to conform to a tech- nical model that is not suitable to their constraints. Such an approach is likely to be advantageous with young athletes, who will experience changes in limb lengths resulting from growth and mat- uration (103). Importantly, the chal- lenge of performing the tasks under different constraints and training variety also has the potential to increase athlete enjoyment, effort, and performance (24).

The level of coach to athlete interaction or amount of feedback may begin high but gradually reduce as the athlete becomes more proficient at the movements, a process known as “scaf- folding.” However, as a result of the non- linear nature of development and skill mastery, the coach must be prepared for random fluctuations in performance and thus the need to alter the amount of feedback accordingly (74). Athletes with a higher training age can process cues and instructions more effectively than a novice (26); therefore, it is impor- tant that during the early stages of learn- ing the weightlifting movements that the coach does not overload the athlete with instruction and feedback, focusing on a maximum of 1–3 key points at any given point in time.

The power development is significantly affected by the optimal position of the body position and the joint angles in the different stages of the movement (35). When the maximum power is reached, the organism only to 10% is supplied with oxygen. During the dynamic and static work of highest intensity the highest degree of energy can be achieved by respiratory arrest and burden (47). The influence of hormones on the increase in muscular strength and the energy of children and young people is of great importance. Muscular work altered hormone levels.

So-called synthetic sex preparations are used in some countries, which increase the natural male sex hormone testosterone as Nerabol, Dianabol, Retabolil and others, products. They have anabolic properties, i.e., they result to a rapid reactivation of the organism after charges.

The values of the maximum force of the static force performance of people are reached very much, which force values of this during a dynamic work.

The ÖGV influ- ences the design of the training only indirectly through the regulation of betting and the stu- dent classes. Since the children in this age group only to maximum 3 times a week a train, the training closely follows the events of the com- petition.

This particular qual- ity can be defined as the ability of an athlete to exert as much force as possible in a limited amount of time (37,46). Maximum strength, in and of itself, is a highly sought-after capability in athletics, but possessing incredible strength and the ability to produce it rapidly are quite different. Merely being strong does not necessarily mean that one also is fast (46). In most sports, it is far more important to display force quickly rather that to just display as much force as possible. Athletes usually do not have enough time to develop maximum force in actual sporting movements, and success often depends on the rate at which force is developed. A classic example is the shot put event in track and field. Shot putters tend to be large and rather strong, and an exceptional shot putter may have a bench press exceeding 180 kg.

The force required to move a barbell that heavy is far more than what is required to throw a 7.26-kg shot and takes considerably more time to produce. The time it takes to produce enough force to throw the shot is significantly less, and the implement would be out of the athlete’s hands long before the level of force required to bench press 180 kg would be achieved. The most critical aspect of the event is how much force is developed during the short amount of time that the shot is in the athlete’s hand. This is not to say that improvements in maximal force cannot aid in the throwing of the shot, but such improvements have been shown to only increase performance up to a certain level early in an athlete’s career, after which time explosiveness becomes the most important quality (46).

For many years, coaches and athletes have used many different approaches to training this quality. These methods have often included weightlifting, which has much support in both research and practice. However, these lifts are far from the only methods available for developing explosiveness and, depending on the circumstances, other methods can prove to be much more effective. SUPPORT FOR TRAINING EXPLOSIVENESS WITH WEIGHTLIFTING One of the most popular ways to develop explosiveness is to train with variations of weightlifting lifts. These include variants of the snatch and the clean and jerk, ranging from partial movements to different combinations and hybrid exercises.

(27) found that the use of the weightlifting lifts in training had a pos- itive effect on performance in sports such as football, basketball, volleyball, and track field. The authors found that the athletes were best trained by the use of movements involving rapid acceleration against resistance that extends throughout the entire move- ment with no intention to decelerate at the end. The pull phase of the clean and snatch, as well as the drive phase of the jerk, display this same sport- specific acceleration pattern. The ki- netics and kinematics of the pull and drive are also quite similar to those involved in jumping other sport move- ments (27).

Garhammer and Gregor (18) reported that the ground reaction force in the snatch was similar to that of countermovement vertical jumps. Stone et al. (41) found the snatch to be biomechanically similar to the vertical jump and also found that weightlifting movements improved vertical jump results. Carlock et al. (10) reported a strong correlation between weightlifting performance and jump performance, as did 2 studies by Hakkinen et al. (23,24). In a study by Tricoli et al.

Similarly, it is important that these movements are done when the athlete is in the best possible condition (i.e., least amount of neuromuscular fatigue) to perform them optimally to stimulate improvements in high-load speed strength (27). Repetitions will typically be between 1 and 3 for full snatches and cleans, and up to 5 repeti- tions for partial snatches and cleans (46). A coach can decide to use traditional repetition planning (one repetition after another during a set) or cluster training for a superior neural response (22). An example of training for explosiveness using the power snatch can be seen in Table 1.

Whether performing the lifts in their entirety (with squat catches) or using different power–style variants (with half-squat catches), the training can fluctuate between very intense and heavy, light and fast, or even used for purposes of recovery or unloading depending on the intensity level pro- grammed for each set. The use of squat cleans and squat snatches can allow for more loading, whereas power cleans and power snatches can be used to target speed strength performance. Pull- ing from different heights, from blocks, or from the hang also can create a novel training stimulus and help further de- velop an athlete’s explosiveness while avoiding monotonous or stagnant train- ing.

If a college or pro- fessional athlete has reached an elite level without using weightlifting, chances are that taking the time and effort to learn these movements from a beginner level will not improve their sport performance that much more than any other type of explosive training.

If the athlete has excellent strength and power specific to their sport and can maximize this through different means of explosive training, then there is no need for them to learn and master weightlifting in training.

ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF TRAINING EXPLOSIVENESS There is considerable research support for explosive training methods that do not involve the use of weightlifting. Much of this information focuses on combining traditional resistance train- ing with plyometric or power training. This type of training has been shown to improve measurements of power, such as the vertical jump, in as little as 3 weeks (34). Concerning acute responses to this type of training, studies have shown an increase in muscle twitch tension after high intensity contrac- tions, leading to improved power performance (14,19,20). Explosiveness by the muscles is improved as the result of increased neuromuscular activation after maximal contractions (14,19,20). Loads do not necessarily have to be maximal in order for the athlete to gain benefit from this type of training (38).

For example, the use of a 5-repetition maximum back squat has been shown to excite the neuromuscular system enough to dramatically improve power performance of subsequent activity using lighter or no loading (43,45). Although this effect is a viable outcome with heavy loads such as this, far lighter loads (as low as 10% of the athlete’s bodyweight or bodyweight alone) have also been shown to cause enough stim- ulation to improve ensuing explosive performance (2,9,12). Improvements in explosive performance measurements such as maximum jump squat height and maximum jump squat power out- put have been produced by using jump squat training alone or by training that combines both squats and jump squat training (12).

The types of exercises chosen, as well as their volume and load, can also effect how successful the combination training is at provoking an improved power response.

This result corre- lates with other studies that suggest that optimum loads for power exer- cises such as the jump squat and ballistic bench press should be within the 15–60% range (4,5,28,44).

It is interesting to note that the subjects in this study did not use loaded jump squats in training. Instead, the authors implemented bodyweight-only jump squats and still found improvements in both unloaded and loaded jump squat tests.

Additionally, the simplicity of the movements involved (such as squatting and jumping) allow for the coach to create and implement many different varieties of exercise, which can make training more interesting for the athlete.

This type of training has been shown to be highly effective in developing explosiveness in the short term (19,20,35,43). It has been suggested that in order for plyometric or power training to be most effective, it must be performed at the beginning of a workout or on a separate day, when the body is experiencing the least amount of fatigue and most capable of producing peak power output (35). However, although power training alone can cause improvements in explosive per- formance (29,30,33), its combination with strength training creates far greater improvement in this particular quality than either power or strength training on its irrespective of the level of the athlete (1,4,5,13,31,34,41).

Tradi- tional combination training could be effective with beginners and athletes with low levels of strength. However, although studies have indicated that this type of training can have a positive effect on explosive performance, these results can only be considered one- time or acute (14,45).

The sky is often the limit when pairing heavy and light exercises, and the variety not only keeps the athletes interested but also provides novel stimuli to the body as well. As a rule, when training for explosiveness, it is helpful to use exercises that involve multiple muscle groups and that are as specific to the athlete’s respective sport as possible. For example, when training a hockey athlete, a coach could decide to pair the back squat with plyometric exercise involving skating motions or diagonal hopping from a slanted box to another slanted box. For more examples of exercise pairings, refer to Table 9.

{"text":"Y Whether a coach decides to use weightlifting, or a variation of combi- nation training is ultimately a matter of individual preference based upon the status and needs of the athletes. Both methods clearly have support in prac- tice and research. What is most important is that coaches approach training with an open mind and avoid a narrow and rigid view of how to train explosiveness. There are situations, as highlighted in the preceding sections, in which an athlete may benefit far more from explosiveness training that does not involve weightlifting. A coach will benefit as well, avoiding needless frustration and wasted time teaching complex exercises to athletes who either do not want or need to learn them. However, an athlete may be particularly interested and adept at weightlifting and may decide to use those movements in training.

Key Words - Youth, children, adolescents, weightlifting, injury, long term athlete development (LTAD). INTRODUCTION Weightlifting is a strength/power sport and training methodology that involves the performance of the snatch and clean and jer k, as well as an assortment of modified variations of these lifts. The lifts are carried out in an explosive and h ighly technical manner and require a high degree of skill to move the bar from the floor to above the head in one or two movements (11, 18, 29, 31, 39) . It is important not to c onfuse the terms weight lifting, resi stance training, or powerlifting as it is its own unique subset of strength training (29, 31) .

In 1983, the American Academy of Paediatrics originally proposed that weightlifting undertaken by children was an unnece ssary risk, and that pre - pubertal children were unable to increase strength or muscle mass because they lacked the circul ating androgen hormones. The paper concluded that weightlifting was unsafe, potentially injurious to the skeletal system, and should be avoided by preadolescents (34) . A second study published shortly after by Sewall and Micheli (37) als o reiterated these beliefs and proposed that any resistive training for pre - adolescents should be carried out with slow a nd controlled speeds and that competition in weightlifting should not be undertaken until after skeletal maturity is achieved (37) .

This positional standpoint, in conjunction with isolated reports of catastrophic injury assoc iated with weight training, significantly impacted the medical community’s perception of youth weightlifting for over two decades (33, 35, 41) . It also created a significant challenge for experienced coaches and te achers who wanted to introduce young athletes to more advanced training techniques and the sport of weightlifting (18) . It is still quit e common to see age restrictions placed on children and adolescence (often 16 - 18yrs) in strength training facilities in countries like North America, Australia, Great Britain, and much of Europe today (35, 38) .

DISCUSSION Injuries and Risks Associated with Youth Weightlifting Original concerns of youth involv ement in weightlifting were related to the potential damage to the epiphyseal growth plates of a developing child’ s bone structure (24) . Although it is well known that the epiphyseal growth plate is much weaker than the surrounding connective tissue, there is no evidence within the literature to suggest that weightlifting, and more generally resistance training, causes injury to these str uctural components particularly when delivered by a qualified professional (24, 3 1) .","meta":{"title":"woods-b-jasc-2703","file":"woods-b-jasc-2703.pdf"}}
{"text":"generally resistance training, causes injury to these str uctural components particularly when delivered by a qualified professional (24, 3 1) . The risks prevalent to weightlifting that have been documented in the literature include factors such as unsafe environment and equipment, overly fatigued training, poor technique, excessive load and volume of training, limited rest intervals and re covery, and lack of qualified supervision (12, 14, 24, 31, 38) (41, 42). Researchers have also previously highlighted the importance of not treating children like “miniature adults” owing to clear differences in p hysical growth and stature and their requirements for slightly alte red training regimes (30 , 42). Although there are some risks associated with youth participation in weightlifting, they can be greatly reduced with appropriate sup ervision and instruction from coaches, sensible program design progressions, and careful selection of training equipment (12, 31) .

In 1979, over half of the 35,512 “weightlifting” injuries requiring emergency room treatment in the United States involved 10 - 19 year olds, with the 1987 report showing 8,590 children 14 and under were taken to the emergency room for similar rel ated injuries (13) .

Although there is a gene ral consensus that technique and skills mastery should be engaged from a young age followed by progressions into higher volumes and intensities, the progressions are rather ambiguous and thus future stu dies may benefit from focusing on a more sequential ba sed approach with each stage of the LTAD including; fundamentals, learn to train, train to train, train to compete","meta":{"title":"woods-b-jasc-2703","file":"woods-b-jasc-2703.pdf"}}

There are some suggestions for coaches and athletes within the liter ature for the practical application and programming of weightlifting for children and adolescence, however more research is needed. Therefore, future research may also profit from examining the specifics of weightlifting programming including intensities, volumes, set/repetition ranges, as well as movement pa tterns to create greater improvements to the athletic potential of the youth.

{"text":"lympic Games to elite senior competition to determine why the dropout rate is so hi gh and the possibility of junior athletes peaking their athletic potential at too young an age through the application of elite adult programs and training loads being too high. Another possible avenu e for future research is the health of retired weightl ifting athletes and an examination of the percentage of problems to their lower back and knees. The current literature highlights a possible risk of these areas in weightlifters due to the high training loads (particularly in the later stages of their care ers (42)) and it would be beneficial to understand the extent to which these problems extend once the athletes have retired from the sport. There should also be a push to educate the public and profes sionals within the industry of the current literature findings and the change in direction to understand that youth weightlifting can be a safe and effective method of training if the pro","meta":{"title":"woods-b-jasc-2703","file":"woods-b-jasc-2703.pdf"}}

This would, with any luck, result in the adoption o f weightlifting by schools and youth sporting clubs worldwide ultimately increasing the athletic potential of the youngsters, reducing their risk of injury within the sports they play, and provide a bet ter quality of life for youths overall. CONCLUSIONS A ND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS • Despite a history of scrutiny over the safety of youth participation in weightlifting and its incorporation into resistance training regimes, the literature clearly indicates that it can be safe, effective and enjoyable if it is supervised, and correct pro gramme progression is implemented by qualified professionals.
